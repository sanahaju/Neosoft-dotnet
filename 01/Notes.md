## Version Control System
- We use VCSs to collaborate as a team of programmars, track changes, do code review and much more...
- This can be of 2 types
	- Distributed VCS
		- Github, BitBucket, Gitlab etc...
	- Centralized VCS
		- TFS, VSTS, SVN

## Basic Git and commands
- `cd 'path'` -> change directory
- `cd ..` -> moves a level up
	- use arrow keys to see history of previously use commands
	- history -> gives a track of all commands you have used in the current session
- `cd ./ tab key` -> gives the auto-completion of the file/directory
- `ls` -> list all the files and directories
- `mkdir 'directory name'` -> make directory
- `touch 'file name.extension'` -> creates a file
- `git clone 'url'` -> adds the local workspace in your machine
- `git add` -> adds the file you target to add to git
- `git add -A` -> adds all the file
- `git commit -m 'message'` -> Stage changes and commit to git as a new node
- `git push` -> push changes to git server
- `git status` -> see the new tracks/ changes made in local workspace
- `git pull` -> retrieve changes from the git server (updates your workspace with latest code)
- `pwd` -> print where directory
